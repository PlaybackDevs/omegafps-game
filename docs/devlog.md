## 3/29/17 Photoshop and Maya 2016 (Spectre)

Sorry for the long wait time, but we've been working really hard and we simply don't have time

to update, as well as updating our modeling pipeline with Maya 2016 and Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.

## 2/21/17 Unity switch (createjump)

We (rather me...) are switching to Unity, to make development easier.

This means that we can use other languages, such as C# and JavaScript.

Mainly I will be using C# as my primary language.
