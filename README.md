# Playback
A top-down medevil slasher written in C++. 

# Build Instructions

## Prerequisites
Install Visual Studio 2013 Express. I'm serious. That's all you have to do. Well, at least until the Steamworks API is implemented.

## Windows
Open the "playback.sln" file.  Click "Build-> Build Solution", or press the F7 key on your keyboard.

# What is the "devs_images" folder?
That folder is used for gource. If you become a new contributer, your profile image will be put in that folder for progress report videos.
